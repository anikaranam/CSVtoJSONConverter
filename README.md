# CSVtoJSONConverter

** This program allows the user to enter a URL for a CSV file in the command line. The program then leverages the download-file npm module to download the specified CSV file.
The program then reads the CSV file, converts it into a JSON object, and writes the results to a file called output.json using the fs module**
